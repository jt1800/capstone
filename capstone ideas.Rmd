#Spotify's Daily Song Rankings

Spotify has a list of the daily top 200 songs for every country. An analysis of the rankings of songs in each country could be useful for concert sales, to decide which countries to include in a tour. 



#San Francisco Bike Share

Bike Rentals in San Francisco can be analyzed to reveal patterns in bike usage, to predict where pedestrians will be during peak business hours and determine the best location to start a business. 



#Yelp

Yelp has review data for businesses, but for businesses with small numbers of ratings, their average score might not be a good indicator of their quality. By analyzing word frequency in reviews and giving more weight to reviewers with good reputation we can predict the eventual score of the business, giving better information to users looking for new businesses to visit.
